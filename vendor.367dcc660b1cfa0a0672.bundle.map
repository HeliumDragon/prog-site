As this is a very common case for `ngModel`, we added this second change\n * detection run.\n *\n * Notes:\n * - this is just one extra run no matter how many `ngModel` have been changed.\n * - this is a general problem when using `exportAs` for directives!\n */\nvar /** @type {?} */ resolvedPromise = Promise.resolve(null);\n/**\n *  to a form control element.\n  * *\n  * The {@link FormControl} instance will track the value, user interaction, and\n  * validation status of the control and keep the view synced with the model. If used\n  * within a parent form, the directive will also register itself with the form as a child\n  * control.\n  * *\n  * *\n  * This directive can be used by itself or as part of a larger form. All you need is the\n  * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n  * *\n  * It accepts a domain model as an optional {@link @Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n  * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n  * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n  * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n  * the domain model in your class as well.\n  * *\n  * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {@link FormControl} (like\n  * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n  * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n  * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n  * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n  * full list of properties directly available in {@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n  * *\n  * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n  * *\n  * {@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n  * *\n  * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n  * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n  * *\n  * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n  * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n  * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n  * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n  * *\n  * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n  * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n  * than the domain model's value on submit.\n  * *\n  * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n  * *\n  * {@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n  * *\n  * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n  * *\n  * * Radio buttons: {@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n  * * Selects: {@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n  * *\n  * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n  * *\n  * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n  * *\n  * @stable\n */\nvar NgModel = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgModel, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} parent\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     * @param {?} valueAccessors\n     */\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        /** @internal */\n        this._control = new __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__model__[\"b\" /* FormControl */]();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._registered = false;\n        this.update = new __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__facade_async__[\"a\" /* EventEmitter */]();\n        this._parent = parent;\n        this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        this.valueAccessor = __webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_10__shared__[\"f\" /* selectValueAccessor */])(this, valueAccessors);\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        this._checkForErrors();\n        if (!this._registered)\n            this._setUpControl();\n        if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n            this._updateDisabled(changes);\n        }\n        if (__webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_10__shared__[\"g\" /* isPropertyUpdated */])(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n            this._updateValue(this.model);\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this);

These come in handy when you want to perform validation\n  * that considers the value of more than one child control.\n  * *\n  * ### Example\n  * *\n  * ```\n  * const form = new FormGroup({\n  * password: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),\n  * passwordConfirm: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),\n  * }, passwordMatchValidator);\n  * *\n  * *\n  * function passwordMatchValidator(g: FormGroup) {\n  * return g.get('password').value === g.get('passwordConfirm').value\n  * ? null : {'mismatch': true};\n  * }\n  * ```\n  * *\n  * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n  * *\n */\nvar FormGroup = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormGroup, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} controls\n     * @param {?=} validator\n     * @param {?=} asyncValidator\n     */\n    function FormGroup(controls, validator, asyncValidator) {\n        if (validator === void 0) { validator = null; }\n        if (asyncValidator === void 0) { asyncValidator = null; }\n        _super.call(this, validator, asyncValidator);\n        this.controls = controls;\n        this._initObservables();\n        this._setUpControls();\n        this.updateValueAndValidity({ onlySelf: true, emitEvent: false });\n    }\n    /**\n     *  Registers a control with the group's list of controls.\n      * *\n      * This method does not update value or validity of the control, so for\n      * most cases you'll want to use {@link FormGroup.addControl} instead.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.registerControl = function (name, control) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            return this.controls[name];\n        this.controls[name] = control;\n        control.setParent(this);\n        control._registerOnCollectionChange(this._onCollectionChange);\n        return control;\n    };\n    /**\n     *  Add a control to this group.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.addControl = function (name, control) {\n        this.registerControl(name, control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     *  Remove a control from this group.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.removeControl = function (name) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            this.controls[name]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        delete (this.controls[name]);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     *  Replace an existing control.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.setControl = function (name, control) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            this.controls[name]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        delete (this.controls[name]);\n        if (control)\n            this.registerControl(name, control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     *  Check whether there is an enabled control with the given name in the group.\n      * *\n      * It will return false for disabled controls.

The context for\n  * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n  * to the current item from the iterable.\n  * *\n  * ### Local Variables\n  * *\n  * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n  * *\n  * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n  * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n  * iteration.\n  * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n  * iteration.\n  * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n  * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n  * *\n  * ### Change Propagation\n  * *\n  * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n  * *\n  * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n  * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n  * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n  * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n  * *\n  * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n  * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n  * controls\n  * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n  * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n  * as user input.\n  * *\n  * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n  * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n  * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n  * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n  * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n  * be avoided if possible.\n  * *\n  * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgFor` supports `trackBy` option.\n  * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n  * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n  * *\n  * ### Syntax\n  * *\n  * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n  * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n  * *\n  * With `<template>` element:\n  * *\n  * ```\n  * <template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n  * <li>...</li>\n  * </template>\n  * ```\n  * *\n  * ### Example\n  * *\n  * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n  * example.\n  * *\n */\nvar NgFor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _viewContainer\n     * @param {?} _template\n     * @param {?} _differs\n     * @param {?} _cdr\n     */\n    function NgFor(_viewContainer, _template, _differs, _cdr) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._template = _template;\n        this._differs = _differs;\n        this._cdr = _cdr;\n        this._differ = null;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTrackBy\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._trackByFn; },\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (fn) {\n            if (__webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__angular_core__[\"m\" /* isDevMode */])() && fn != null && typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                // TODO(vicb): use a log service once there is a public one available\n                if ((console) && (console.warn)) {\n                    console.warn((\"trackBy must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn) + \". \") +\n                        \"See https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/NgFor-directive.html#!#change-propagation for more information.\");\n                }\n            }\n            this._trackByFn = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (value) {\n            if (value) {\n                this._template = value;\n            }\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgFor.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n            // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n            var /** @type {?} */ value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n            if (!this._differ && value) {\n                try {\n                    this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this._cdr, this.ngForTrackBy);\n                }\n                catch (e) {\n                    throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + __webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__facade_lang__[\"f\" /* getTypeNameForDebugging */])(value) + \"'.

Unlike {@link FormControlName},\n  * it does not require that your {@link FormControl} instance be part of any parent\n  * {@link FormGroup}, and it won't be registered to any {@link FormGroupDirective} that\n  * exists above it.\n  * *\n  * **Get the value**: the `value` property is always synced and available on the\n  * {@link FormControl} instance. See a full list of available properties in\n  * {@link AbstractControl}.\n  * *\n  * **Set the value**: You can pass in an initial value when instantiating the {@link FormControl},\n  * or you can set it programmatically later using {@link AbstractControl.setValue} or\n  * {@link AbstractControl.patchValue}.\n  * *\n  * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the control, you can\n  * subscribe to the {@link AbstractControl.valueChanges} event.

This disallows HTML entities used in the\n * protocol name, which should never happen, e.g. \"h&#116;tp\" for \"http\".\n * It also disallows HTML entities in the first path part of a relative path,\n * e.g. \"foo&lt;bar/baz\".

Calls to `animate` are expected to be\n  * used within {@link sequence an animation sequence}, {@link group group}, or {@link transition\n  * transition}.\n  * *\n  * ### Usage\n  * *\n  * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:\n  * *\n  * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional\n  * delay and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`\n  * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,\n  * delay=100, easing=ease-out`.\n  * If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the `duration` value in millisecond\n  * form.\n  * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {@link style style} or {@link\n  * keyframes keyframes}.\n  * If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected and used (this is\n  * useful when\n  * describing an animation step that will complete an animation by {@link\n  * transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).\n  * *\n  * ```typescript\n  * // various functions for specifying timing data\n  * animate(500, style(...))\n  * animate(\"1s\", style(...))\n  * animate(\"100ms 0.5s\", style(...))\n  * animate(\"5s ease\", style(...))\n  * animate(\"5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)\", style(...))\n  * *\n  * // either style() of keyframes() can be used\n  * animate(500, style({ background: \"red\" }))\n  * animate(500, keyframes([\n  * style({ background: \"blue\" })),\n  * style({ background: \"red\" }))\n  * ])\n  * ```\n  * *\n  * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))\n  * *\n  * {@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n  * *\n * @param {?} timing\n * @param {?=} styles\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction animate(timing, styles) {\n    if (styles === void 0) { styles = null; }\n    var /** @type {?} */ stylesEntry = styles;\n    if (!__webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__facade_lang__[\"d\" /* isPresent */])(stylesEntry)) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ EMPTY_STYLE = {};\n        stylesEntry = new AnimationStyleMetadata([EMPTY_STYLE], 1);\n    }\n    return new AnimationAnimateMetadata(timing, stylesEntry);\n}\n/**\n *  `group` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's\n  * animation\n  * DSL language.

All you need is the\n  * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n  * *\n  * It accepts a domain model as an optional {@link @Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n  * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n  * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n  * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n  * the domain model in your class as well.\n  * *\n  * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {@link FormControl} (like\n  * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n  * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n  * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n  * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n  * full list of properties directly available in {@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n  * *\n  * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n  * *\n  * {@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n  * *\n  * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n  * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n  * *\n  * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n  * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n  * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n  * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n  * *\n  * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n  * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n  * than the domain model's value on submit.\n  * *\n  * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n  * *\n  * {@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n  * *\n  * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n  * *\n  * * Radio buttons: {@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n  * * Selects: {@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n  * *\n  * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n  * *\n  * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n  * *\n  * @stable\n */\nexport var NgModel = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgModel, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} parent\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     * @param {?} valueAccessors\n     */\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        /** @internal */\n        this._control = new FormControl();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._registered = false;\n        this.update = new EventEmitter();\n        this._parent = parent;\n        this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(this, valueAccessors);\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        this._checkForErrors();\n        if (!this._registered)\n            this._setUpControl();\n        if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n            this._updateDisabled(changes);\n        }\n        if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n            this._updateValue(this.model);\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this); };\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"control\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._control; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"path\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () {\n            return this._parent ?

These come in handy when you want to perform validation\n  * that considers the value of more than one child control.\n  * *\n  * ### Example\n  * *\n  * ```\n  * const form = new FormGroup({\n  * password: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),\n  * passwordConfirm: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),\n  * }, passwordMatchValidator);\n  * *\n  * *\n  * function passwordMatchValidator(g: FormGroup) {\n  * return g.get('password').value === g.get('passwordConfirm').value\n  * ? null : {'mismatch': true};\n  * }\n  * ```\n  * *\n  * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n  * *\n */\nexport var FormGroup = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormGroup, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} controls\n     * @param {?=} validator\n     * @param {?=} asyncValidator\n     */\n    function FormGroup(controls, validator, asyncValidator) {\n        if (validator === void 0) { validator = null; }\n        if (asyncValidator === void 0) { asyncValidator = null; }\n        _super.call(this, validator, asyncValidator);\n        this.controls = controls;\n        this._initObservables();\n        this._setUpControls();\n        this.updateValueAndValidity({ onlySelf: true, emitEvent: false });\n    }\n    /**\n     *  Registers a control with the group's list of controls.\n      * *\n      * This method does not update value or validity of the control, so for\n      * most cases you'll want to use {@link FormGroup.addControl} instead.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.registerControl = function (name, control) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            return this.controls[name];\n        this.controls[name] = control;\n        control.setParent(this);\n        control._registerOnCollectionChange(this._onCollectionChange);\n        return control;\n    };\n    /**\n     *  Add a control to this group.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.addControl = function (name, control) {\n        this.registerControl(name, control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     *  Remove a control from this group.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.removeControl = function (name) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            this.controls[name]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        delete (this.controls[name]);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     *  Replace an existing control.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.setControl = function (name, control) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            this.controls[name]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        delete (this.controls[name]);\n        if (control)\n            this.registerControl(name, control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     *  Check whether there is an enabled control with the given name in the group.\n      * *\n      * It will return false for disabled controls.

The context for\n  * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n  * to the current item from the iterable.\n  * *\n  * ### Local Variables\n  * *\n  * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n  * *\n  * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n  * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n  * iteration.\n  * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n  * iteration.\n  * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n  * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n  * *\n  * ### Change Propagation\n  * *\n  * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n  * *\n  * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n  * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n  * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n  * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n  * *\n  * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n  * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n  * controls\n  * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n  * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n  * as user input.\n  * *\n  * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n  * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n  * RPC is re-run.

The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`\n  * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,\n  * delay=100, easing=ease-out`.\n  * If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the `duration` value in millisecond\n  * form.\n  * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {@link style style} or {@link\n  * keyframes keyframes}.\n  * If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected and used (this is\n  * useful when\n  * describing an animation step that will complete an animation by {@link\n  * transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).\n  * *\n  * ```typescript\n  * // various functions for specifying timing data\n  * animate(500, style(...))\n  * animate(\"1s\", style(...))\n  * animate(\"100ms 0.5s\", style(...))\n  * animate(\"5s ease\", style(...))\n  * animate(\"5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)\", style(...))\n  * *\n  * // either style() of keyframes() can be used\n  * animate(500, style({ background: \"red\" }))\n  * animate(500, keyframes([\n  * style({ background: \"blue\" })),\n  * style({ background: \"red\" }))\n  * ])\n  * ```\n  * *\n  * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))\n  * *\n  * {@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n  * *\n * @param {?} timing\n * @param {?=} styles\n * @return {?}\n */\nexport function animate(timing, styles) {\n    if (styles === void 0) { styles = null; }\n    var /** @type {?} */ stylesEntry = styles;\n    if (!isPresent(stylesEntry)) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ EMPTY_STYLE = {};\n        stylesEntry = new AnimationStyleMetadata([EMPTY_STYLE], 1);\n    }\n    return new AnimationAnimateMetadata(timing, stylesEntry);\n}\n/**\n *  `group` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's\n  * animation\n  * DSL language.
